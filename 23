  -   Using develop tools to create or  manage batch job / pipeline 
       XFlow  https://github.com/menghot/xflow/ ? The airflow plugin to support create airflow dag in GUI 
       Anything is a SQL table,  ETL/ data processing using SQL (run by Trino or spark)
       Data processing engine(spark/flink/trino) management 
       
  -  Unified metadata management (open metadata)
       Enhance cracn-metadata-service to support more flexible metadata (for data mash useage)

  -  Data governance support (using open metadata?)
      Support data quality control 
      Support data lineage support 
      Support data lifecycle support 
      Support data SLA management/monitoring

 -    Data security ?   
       Using Trino + OPA / Apache Ranger? 
       (Denodo has not support data filtering push-down for data security)

 -   Data mesh
      Data domain driven (utilizing data governance, open-metadata ?)

      Support data assets exporting using API interface, (export as API  or SQL interface and apply same data security control, Denodo  not supported)

      Support Metadata or Data auto Discovery (Trino XFile)
      (Denodo not support the csv, excel, parquet file auto registry/discovering,  denodo needs create all data assets manually)

      Fix performance issue (Large dataset join large dataset case).  Dynamic filter push down ,   E.g  , Join STAR API 
      Query engine enhancement (support  customizd data source authentication)
